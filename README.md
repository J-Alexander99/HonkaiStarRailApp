## Honkai Star Rail App

This is an App that players of Honkai Star Rail can use to keep track and plan their wishes to help ensure they get the characters they want in the future.

# What does it do?
There are currently two purposes within the app these are as follows:
1. Allow users to calculate how many wishes they will have when their desired character is released.
2. Allow users to perform simulations to find out the odds they will have of getting those characters.

# How does it accomplish this?

Simply put, looking at the amount of free and paid wishes Star Rail provides the player over any given update we can get data we can extrapolate to the future. This gives us a relativly accurate estimate on how many wishes will be given in future updates.
From here those wishes are entered into a simulation that attempts to pull the desired characters and lightcones under the same conditions used in the game. From here, every success and failure is counted to give a percent chance of overall success.
This can be accomplished as follows:

This menu has two current options, first the wish calculator and then second wish simulator.
We are going to click on the wish calculator first.
This will take us to the following screen:
